# Python for Data Science #2 

This is an adaptation of @BobbyTaylor82 Python Challenge Twitter API. 

I got to it inspired by @llSourcell's 'Learn Python for Data Science' <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_OZdbCzHUA&t=3s'>Youtube</a> series.

Siraj's challenge was to save each Tweet to a CSV file with an associated label ('Positive' or 'Negative'). BobbyTaylor82 took that one step further with cool dataviz and data frames. 

I read vader is better for social sentiment analysis, so I'll stick with BobbyTaylor82's choice.
